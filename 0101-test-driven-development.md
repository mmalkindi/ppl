# Understanding Test Driven Development

## What is Test Driven Development?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a form of writing code where tests are written first before the production code.
Both test and production code will also go through a refactoring process after all tests have been passed.
After each test case is complete, repeat and continue to the next one.

## Why follow Test Driven Development?

TDD forces developers to define requirements for their program before writing any piece of code,
as they need to know all tests that needs to be written before the production code.
This aims to help developers understand their code better and cut the time used for debugging and scoping out requirements during the code writing process.

## When to use Test Driven Development?

Unless you're working on a small/quick project, it's generally advisable to use TDD.
